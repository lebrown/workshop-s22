Jupyter notebooks support over 40 different programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, Scala, etc.\n","\n","Notebooks are used for *literate programming*, a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, or a natural language. In other words, the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. This approach to programming effectively treats software as works of literature ([Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), \"Literate Programming\").  It supports people to have a strong conceptual map of what is happening in the code and also have clarity on the flow and logic of the code/program. which is helpful for both for the writer and the reader.\n","\n","Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that combine code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education because they enable students  to engage with content presented in different forms, , experience computation with no prior experience, and practice programming in a scaffolded way. \n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n","In this session, we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to introduce you to how data scientists work with data, to learn about issues of justice using real-world data sets, and to also learn how to reason about the human choices embedded in the practice of data science and their significance.\n","</div>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T9LaHe33bzqp"},"source":["### Notebook Structure \n","\n","A notebook is composed of rectangular sections called **cells**.
